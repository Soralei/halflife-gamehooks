# halflife-gamehooks

Made for educational purposes only. The DLL was designed to be injected into Half Life 1 in order to change functionality and test the limits of the engine. It is NOT designed for multiplayer and was solely made targeting singleplayer.

It supports:

## ESP
- Tracks NPCs, their type, health and such through walls (this was really hard as to make...)

## Noclip
- Allows flying at different speeds with no limitations

## Clientside Freecam
- Allows the player to de-attach the camera and fly around while physically remaining on spot
